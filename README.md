# Part 2 Address book

## Task
In this task you will need to create a simple address book using single linked list. You will need to use C programming language. 

Address book should save this information:

* Name
* Surname
* Email
* Phone number

Your program should have this functionality:

* Display all records in the address book
* Add new address to the book (to the end)
* Add new address indicating the position where to put it
* Delete address indicating its position in the book
* Delete whole address book
* Find address by position
* Find address by name, surname, email or phone number

All the addresses must be entered by the user.

By default, address book must have at least 10 addresses which should be loaded from a .csv file. File must go by the name addresses.csv. The program should look for this file of that user's home directory who started the program. The program should continue its work if the file doesn't exist. 

All linked list code part must be stored in a separate .c file.

All of your code must be stored in a gitlab repository. Also, you can use other git services provider. 

The user must be provided with an interactive menu which will be used for the user to interact with the program and execute different actions. 

## Running
Execute `build.sh` script to generate the address book executable, then simply run it.

## Issues
* None that I have found

## Notes
The indexing for the linked list methods starts from 1, simply quicker to associate the user-displayed value in the program.
